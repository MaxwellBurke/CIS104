#Read integers from the keyboard until zero is read, storing them in input order in an array A.
#Then copy them to another array B doubling each integer (i.e. after the
#copying of n integers and assuming you are using item 0 of the arrays,
#then for all i such that 0 <= i < n,  B[i] = A[i]*2 ). Then print B.
